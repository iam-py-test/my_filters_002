### How to support this project
You can support this project by:
- Using these lists & reporting problems
- Submitting entries (malware, porn, cookie banners)
- Helping me extend support for diffrent browsers & adblockers
- Helping me translate things into other languages (Sadly the only language I know is EN-US) and make this project more accessible
- Helping verify entries & submit them to other lists 

If you have another way to contriute, I will gladly accept any help I can get<br><br>

### How to report bugs or ask for help
If you want to report a bug or ask for help, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001/issues/new/choose). I also plan on creating an email address for people without GitHub accounts, but that may take a while.
